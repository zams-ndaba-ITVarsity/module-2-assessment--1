            <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
            <p>Giraffes are the tallest mammals on Earth. Their legs alone are taller than many humans—about 6 feet.[1]
                They can run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances, or cruise at 10 mph over longer distances.[2]
                A giraffe's neck is too short to reach the ground. As a result, it has to awkwardly spread its front legs or kneel to reach the ground for a drink of water.[3]
                Giraffes only need to drink once every few days. Most of their water comes from all the plants they eat.[4]
                Giraffes spend most of their lives standing up; they even sleep and give birth standing up.[5]</p>
            <p>The giraffe calf can stand up and walk after about an hour and within a week, it starts to sample vegetation.[6]
                Despite the females’ attempts to stand over their calves during attacks by lions, spotted hyenas, leopards and African wild dogs (4), many calves are killed in their first few months.[7]
                A giraffe’s spots are much like human fingerprints. No two individual giraffes have exactly the same pattern.[8]
                Both male and female giraffes have two distinct, hair-covered horns called ossicones. Male giraffes use their horns to sometimes fight with other males</p>
             <p>Up until recently, it was thought that there was one extant species of giraffe, Giraffa Camelopardalis. However, recent research by scientists has shown that there are four species: Northern giraffe (Giraffa     Camelopardalis), Southern giraffe (Giraffa giraffe), Masai giraffe (Giraffa tippelskirchi), and reticulated giraffe (Giraffa reticulata).</p>
            <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
            <p>You will find the giraffes at pen E5, right next to the koalas</p>
